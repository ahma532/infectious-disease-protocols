# Legionnaires' Disease Management Protocol

## Diagnosis

Current diagnostic methods include:

- Culture of respiratory secretions (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage) on selective media
- Serology for detection of antibodies (fourfold rise in convalescent titers)
- Direct fluorescent antibody staining of respiratory specimens
- Urinary antigen test for *Legionella pneumophila* serogroup 1 (new, highly sensitive test offering rapid results with high sensitivity and specificity; primarily detects *L. pneumophila* serogroup 1, which accounts for the majority of cases. It is now considered standard practice for early diagnosis.)

## Treatment

Empirical therapy with a macrolide or fluoroquinolone is recommended.

## Prevention

Maintenance of water systems to prevent Legionella colonization.
